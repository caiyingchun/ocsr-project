dbQOSR - a tool that provides an opportunity to perform quality-aware Optical Chemical Structure Recognition for large image databases.

This project was developed with:
  - Ubuntu
  - Python 2.7.6
  - OSRA (both 1.4.0 and 2.0.1 are supported)
No tests for other versions of required projects were held.

Usage: 

python core.py [-h] -i I [-f {png,jpg,mol,smi}] [-o O] [-d] [-v {1.4.0,2.0.1}]
               [-a {cmp,corr}] [-r] [-s]

example: python core.py -i ./data/anti -o 

This script allows to use OSRA for processing big datasets and evaluate
quality of the result.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

I/O Options:
  -i I                  path to the database directory 
  -f {png,jpg,mol,smi}  input file format (defaults: corr - png, cmp - mol)
  -o O                  name of the result (is used to create a directory in
                        'res' folder, default - database folder name)

Setting parameters:
  -d                    debug mode (detailed output)
  -v {1.4.0,2.0.1}      OSRA version
  -a {cmp,corr}         Choose an action to perform
  -r                    Restore initial version of 'spelling.txt' file after
                        experiments
  -s                    Turn on auto-corrections

Results:

Path to the folder with results: <project folder>/res/name, where name is specified
with '-o'  argument, or is a name of folder with your database.

Format of the result is not specified yet. Current format:

  - for each image there is a corresponding folder with .smi file (there may be 
    some extra debug files)
  - a report containing information about the quality of the result (in progress)
